image = cv2.imread('your_parking_image.jpg')

# Run the parking analysis
results = analyze_parking_lot(image)
print(f"Total vehicles: {results['total_cars']}")
print(f"Available spaces: {results['empty_spaces']}")
```

#### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple images
image_folder = "path/to/your/images"
results = batch_process_parking_images(image_folder)
```
