# Car Parking System

This repository contains the implementation of a Car Parking System designed to automate the management of vehicle parking within designated areas. This system combines the use of state-of-the-art technology and advanced image processing algorithms to deliver a solution that increases convenience, improves safety and security, and aids in the effective management of parking resources.

## Project Description

Our Car Parking System is focused on the software component, which is responsible for various tasks including:

- Counting the number of cars within a designated parking area
- Calculating the number of empty parking spaces
- Detecting parking alignment
- Identifying cars by color within the parking space

The system's implementation aims to address the challenges posed by the increasing number of vehicles in urban areas. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated through its ability to guide users to available parking spots, thereby reducing traffic congestion and streamlining the parking process.

## Features

- **Vehicle Counting**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to count the number of parked and moving vehicles, as well as vehicles by color.
- **Empty Slot Detection**: Implements image processing techniques to detect and count the number of available parking spaces.
- **Parking Alignment Monitoring**: Ensures that vehicles are parked correctly within the designated spaces.
- **Color Recognition**: Identifies vehicles based on color, focusing on the most frequently appearing colors in the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Image Processing Algorithms
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection


## Usage

Run the system by executing the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Project_CarParkingSystem.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions within the notebook to initiate the car parking system.
